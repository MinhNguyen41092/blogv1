    <h4>WHO AM I?</h4>
    <h5>
      I'm Nguyen Dinh Minh. I'm 24 years old. I was born in Danang city. Despite having a mechatronics engineering degree I've recently discovered a
      great passion for programming, especially the Ruby programming language and Ruby on Rails web application framework. I also enjoy deeply English
      and Western culture. So you won't find many articles related to Vietnam here.
    </h5>
    <h4>SO WHY DID YOU CREATE THIS BLOG?</h4>
    <h5>
      To practice my Rails skills. And to express some of my ideas about some random stuffs that I enjoy. 
    </h5>
    <h4>WHERE DID YOU GET ALL OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE?</h4>
    <h5>
      Mostly from the Internet. I am always in doubt about everything, so I need to do some research to find the answer. But most of the time it only makes things
      even more complicated but that's why life is so interesting, so many fun things out there to learn and write about. And the funniest thing is, one can never find 
      the absolute truth about how life works, realize this and you will never be bored.
    </h5>
    <h4>BESIDE WRITING AND PROGRAMMING, WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER INTERESTS?</h4>
    <h5>
      I love physical training, mainly football and lifting. And if you like books I think we can be friends.
    </h5>
    <h4>WHAT ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA? CAN I STALK YOU?</h4>
    <h5>
      Of course! Beware those nude photos though...
